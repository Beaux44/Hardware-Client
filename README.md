## _A websocket client written in Rust that communicates statistical data about the hardware of the host machine_

### <u>Hardware Client:</u>

- CPU Core Count, CPU Usage, CPU Frequency
- RAM total, Available, Percentage Used
- Total Storage, Available Storage, Used Storage
- Adjustable frequency of communication

## Tech

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

## Installation

The client has been tested on [Rust v.1.68.0](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

_This requires a server to be set up to accept communication, such as [Terrace Dashboard](https://github.com/sockheadrps/Terrace-Dashboard)_

```
cargo run
```
